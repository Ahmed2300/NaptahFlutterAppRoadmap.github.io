## 🎯 How to Use This Roadmap

### For **Ahmed** (Scan Features Lead):
1. Click on each task to open the detailed modal guide
2. Follow the implementation steps in order
3. Use the web app references (App.tsx) to understand logic
4. Test using the provided test cases
5. **Priority**: Gemini Service is critical - focus on this first

### For **Mohamed** (Auth & Services Lead):
1. Start with Auth Service (blocks everything else)
2. Use the Firebase setup guide to configure project
3. Implement Riverpod providers as shown
4. Reference Community.tsx for real-time logic
5. **Priority**: Authentication must work perfectly - spend extra time here

### For **Manar** (UI/UX Lead):
1. Focus on reusable widgets (ProductCard, PostCard)
2. Ensure responsive design for all screens
3. Use the web app as UI reference (WelcomePage.tsx, Marketplace.tsx)
4. Implement pull-to-refresh and lazy loading
5. **Priority**: UI polish in Week 3 is critical for app store approval

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

### ⚠️ DO NOT:
- Start Week 2 without completing authentication
- Skip testing in Week 3 (most important week!)
- Add new features after Week 2
- Ignore performance optimization
- Submit to stores without thorough testing

### ✅ DO:
- Daily team sync meetings (15 minutes)
- Test on physical devices frequently
- Keep scan limit logic consistent with web app
- Use Firebase Transactions for voting
- Compress images before upload
- Handle network errors gracefully
